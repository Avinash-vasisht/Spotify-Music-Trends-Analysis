# Spotify-Music-Trends-Analysis


This project analyzes Spotify music data using Python libraries to uncover patterns and insights related to song features, popularity, and trends.

## Project Highlights
* Data Source: Single CSV file containing Spotify song data.
* Tools Used:
  * Pandas: For data cleaning and analysis.
  * Seaborn and Matplotlib: For data visualization and trend identification.
* Focus Areas:
  * Exploring correlations between song features (e.g., energy, tempo, loudness) and popularity.
  * Visualizing the distribution of key song metrics.
  * Identifying patterns and top trends in the dataset.

## Key Insights
* Song Features: Analysis of tempo, energy, loudness, and their impact on popularity.
* Data Visualizations: Created clear visualizations to identify trends and outliers in the data.
* Popularity Analysis: Highlighted key characteristics of popular songs.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading: Imported the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Cleaning: Removed null values, handled duplicates, and prepared the dataset.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  + Distribution of features like tempo, energy, loudness.
  + Correlation analysis between song features.
4. Visualizations: Generated bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms for trend analysis.
